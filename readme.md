# The Chord Drawer
---------
Written by Roy Gero in Java

##### Purpose of the Program
The purpose of this program is to enable a person to quickly and easily draw a guitar chord diagram. It is meant to accompany my Guitar Trainer, which allows the user to load custom chord diagrams into it so they can customize their practice regimen.

##### Features
A lot of these features are currently being implemented, so this is more of an outline
* Be able to define a chord diagram that contains open strings, muted strings, and the appropriate notes.
* Be able to define a chord diagram that contains barre chords
* Be able to define a chord that is not in the open position. This will be done by signifying the root fret
* Being able to export the chord diagram to a PNG format.
