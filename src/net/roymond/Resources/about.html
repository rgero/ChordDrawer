            This program was created to provide guitar players with an easy tool to draw out Chord Diagrams. From looking at guitar tabs online, I could see
            there were several different ways that people chose to draw chords out. Unfortunately, many of these representations could be confusing, especially
            to a novice guitar player.

            <h2>Features</h2>
            This program contains the following features
            <UL>
                <LI>The ability to define root note, the number of strings and frets you'd like displayed</LI>
                <LI>The ability to define fingerings, muted strings as well as barre chords</LI>
                <LI>The ability to export these graphics to a png file wherever you'd like on your machine</LI>
            </UL>

            Accompanying this program would be the Guitar Trainer. The Guitar Trainer is a program also written by me that aims to help guitarists practice their chord changes.
            The way that the Chord Drawer works with the Guitar Trainer is that you can create custom chords using this, and import them into the Guitar Trainer.
